# Prison Breaks Analysis

## Overview

This project explores prison breaks involving helicopters with the aim of analyzing trends and patterns in the data. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes#Actual_attempts) on helicopter prison escapes. The analysis is conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook and is based on a Dataquest activity.
